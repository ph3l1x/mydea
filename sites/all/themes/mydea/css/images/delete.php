          Porter joined MyDea Marketing in early January 2015 at the early age
          of 5.5 weeks old. Since joining the team, Porter has consistently set
          the standard for attendance and brings a
          relaxed attitude with him every day to work. His primary job
          responsibility is monitoring overall office cleanliness. He routinely
          checks everyone’s trash cans and is the first to
          take anyone’s unwanted lunch. Porter also works as security clearance
          for visitors and guests. His favorite hobby is fetching anything and
          everything and I think we can all agree
          that the office wouldn’t be the same without him.
